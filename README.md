# Insect Detection System

This project detects and classifies insects using an image recognition model. The project is implemented in Python and uses TensorFlow for machine learning.

## Features
- Upload an insect image
- Detect and classify the insect
- Display the result

## Setup
1. Install required libraries: `pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy pillow`
2. Place your trained model file as `insect_detector.h5` in the project folder.

## Run the Project
- Run `main.py` to test the detection system.
- Run `gui.py` for a graphical user interface.

## Notes
- Update `class_names` in the scripts with your trained model's classes.
- Add your own `test_image.jpg` for testing.
